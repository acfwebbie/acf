  <h2>Theme for 2014-2015</h2>
<p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <b>Upward</b>.
</p>

    <p class="verse">Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.<br />
<i>- Colossians 3:1-4 (NIV)</i>
    </p>

<p>Our theme verse, Colossians 3:1-4, is a reflection of the greater message of the Gospel. As believers of Christ, we look to His resurrection as our hope, and understand that the eternal is what we live for. And even in the affliction that we face here, we know that it is both light and momentary, and we believe that they prepare us for the glory to come.</p>

<p>Upward, then, is not meant to say that we are farther up than anyone else. Rather, it is a reminder for us to set our hearts and minds on things above, just as our theme verse says. We look upward, strive for what is upwards, and point one another upward.</p>

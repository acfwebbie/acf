  <h2>Theme for 2013-2014</h2>
    <p>The theme and theme verse are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and fellowship level. This year our theme is <b>Recover</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="verse">For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died;
and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.<br />
<i>- II Corinthians 5:14-15 (ESV)</i>
    </p>
<p>This year, we hope that our theme verse, II Corinthians 5:14-15, conveys the message that we live for Christ alone: we live not for good works, for fellowship, for each other, but for Him who for our sake died and was raised. To live for Christ alone means, in one sense, to live to fulfill the Great Commission. And thus, we fellowship for the sake of living for Christ, instead of devoting our lives to Christ for the sake of fellowship.</p

<p>Recover, then, is a reflection of both what Christ has done for us and what we are to continue in our lives. We have been recovered from sin and from this world by Christ's death and resurrection. So shall we continue the work of recovery in our own lives, giving ourselves whole-heartedly to our God.</p>

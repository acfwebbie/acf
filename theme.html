  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>

    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.</p>

  <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2017-2018</h2>
  <p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <b>Rooted</b>.
</p>

    <p class="verse">“Rather, speaking the truth in love,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are to grow up in every way into him<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is the head, into Christ”<br />
    <i>- Ephesians 4:15 (ESV)</i>
    </p>

  <p>Our theme verse, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A15&version=ESV">Ephesians 4:15</a>, is a call to re-focus on truth, and specifically speaking and living out truth. It is a call to grow up in Christ, leading to our theme word, Rooted. In order for us to experience God-given growth, we must first have a firm foundation in God. We hope to have our roots run deep in the Truth that is His Word and Will and apply God's Truth to our everyday lives, living in a way that is glorifying to Him. </p>

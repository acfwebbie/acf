  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>

    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.</p>

  <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2020-2021</h2>
  <p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <b>Treasure</b>.
</p>

    <p class="verse"> “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where moth and rust[a] destroy and where thieves break in and steal,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.“<br />
    <i>- Matthew 6:19-21 (ESV)</i>
    </p>

  <p>Our theme verse, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206%3A19-21&version=ESV">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, emphasizes the great that God has for us and call us to love one another with the same heart. Our aim is for all ACFers to truly know and appreciate that they are God's beloved.</p>

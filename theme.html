  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>

    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.</p>

  <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2016-2017</h2>
  <p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <b>Be Still</b>.
</p>

    <p class="verse">“Be still, and know that I am God.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be exalted among the nations,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be exalted in the earth!”<br />
    <i>- Psalm 46:10 (ESV)</i>
    </p>

  <p>Our theme verse, Psalm 46:10, is centered around the Sovereignty and Authority of our God and a reminder for us to be still before Him, to trust in His will and His plan. We believe in a God who is the creator of all things, who commands anything and everything roaming the heavens and the earth, and it is in this Father that we place our trust in. As a result of this understanding and belief, we hope to be still before Him, to listen to His commands and follow His ways, throughout all joys and trials we may face.</p>

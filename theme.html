  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>

    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.</p>

  <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2022-2023</h2>
  <p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <u>Aligned</u>. Our theme verse, James 1:25, points to our fellowship’s objective in seeking Christ, both individually and corporately. Our aim is for all ACFers to truly realize that they are God's beloved, and to be equipped with His Word, the truth that transcends the distractions and entangling controversies of this world. This frees us to seek God and love one another for our eternal joy and His eternal glory.

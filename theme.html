  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>

    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.</p>

  <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2015-2016</h2>
  <p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <b>Overflow</b>.
</p>

    <p class="verse">In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.<br />
<i>- 1 John 4:10-12(ESV)</i>
    </p>

  <p>Our theme verse, 1 John 4:10-12, is centered on the greater message of the Gospel. As believers, who we are and what we do are rooted in God's love for us. A love greater than anything in this world. As God's beloved, we hope to overflow from His love by loving others and reflecting who our Father in heaven is.</p>

  <p>Overflow serves as a reminder of how incredible God and His love for us, and also show the world who He is by our love for one another. We look forward to encouraging, challenging, and affirming one another as we reflect on this theme of Overflow.</p>

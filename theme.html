  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>
    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations 
      by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.
    </p>
    <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, 
      a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as 
      they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2024-2025</h2>
  <p>
    The theme is a contextual way in which we can understand our mission statement as a fellowship.
    This year, our theme word is <u>Abide</u> and our theme verse is 
    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A9-10&version=ESV">John 15:9-10</a>.
    These point to our aim for every member of the fellowship to be seeking a deeper 
    personal relationship with Christ through growing in knowledge of His character and what He has accomplished for us on the cross. 
    This personal relationship with Christ should be the motivation behind our love for one another and obedience to His commands.
  </p>

    <p class="verse"> “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. 
      Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, 
      just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.”<br />
      <i>- John 15:9-10 (ESV)</i>

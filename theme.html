  <h2>Mission Statement </h2>

    <p class="verse">The Asian Christian Fellowship seeks to carry out the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of all nations by proclaiming the Gospel, providing fellowship for edification, nurturing Christians in spiritual growth, and building up Christian leaders.</p>

  <p>Our mission statement comes from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, a passage known as the Great Commission. As Jesus' words after his resurrection, we believe that they should be as important to us as they were to Christ's apostles and disciples.

  <h2>Theme for 2018-2019</h2>
  <p>The theme verse and theme are contextual ways in which we can understand our mission statement on both a personal and a fellowship level. This year, our theme is <b>One</b>.
</p>

    <p class="verse">â€œSo if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any participation in the spirit, any afection and sympathy,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being in full accord and of one mind.<br />
    <i>- Philippians 2:1-2 (ESV)</i>
    </p>

  <p>Our theme verse, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A1-2&version=ESV">Philippians 2:1-2</a>, is a call to be unified, not for our own sake for because of Christ. This led to our theme word, One. We should understand what it means to be a part of the unified body of believers in order to apply God's Truth to our everday lives, living in a way that is glorifying to Him.</p>

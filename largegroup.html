      We gather for large group every Friday, rotating locations between Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh campuses. Large group is a time when we gather together as a fellowship to share, love, and learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what exactly can you expect at a typical large group? We open with a time of worship, followed by corporate or small group prayer, and then a sharing by someone in the fellowship. One of our leaders guides us in a topical study, and afterwards we break into smaller discussion groups to talk about the topic in more depth. We reconvene for some closing worship and reflection time. It&#8217;s also not uncommon for us to celebrate birthdays, hang out, or go out to eat afterwards.

      Come check out large group! We hope to see you there.

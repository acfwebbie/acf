      We gather for large group every Friday, rotating locations between Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh campuses. Large group is a time when we gather together as a fellowship to share, love, and learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what exactly can you expect at a typical large group? We open with a time of worship, followed by corporate or small group prayer, and then a sharing by someone in the fellowship. One of our leaders guides us in a topical study, and afterwards we break into smaller discussion groups to talk about the topic in more depth. We reconvene for some closing worship and reflection time. It's also not uncommon for us to celebrate birthdays, hang out, or go out to eat afterwards.

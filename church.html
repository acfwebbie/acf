      Every Sunday, many ACFers attend service and Sunday school at <a href="http://www.pittsburghchinesechurch.org/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Chinese Church</a>. We have a bus which takes us from school to and from PCC, and people nap or chat on the bus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service is a time of worship, sharing, and a sermon from one of the pastors or elders at the church. Most of us go to the English service, but there's also a Mandarin/Cantonese service. On occasion we have a joint congregation service.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the service, there is a choice between traditional Sunday school  and White Harvest, our multigenerational small groups that discuss the message and practical principles for Christian life. Afterwards, we have lunch at church and take the bus back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all ACF members attend PCC. If it's not your cup of tea, take a look at our <a href="/links.html">links page</a> for other local churches.

      Every Sunday, many ACFers attend service and Sunday school at <a href="http://www.pittsburghchinesechurch.org/">Pittsburgh Chinese Church</a>. We have a bus which takes us from school to and from PCC, and people nap or chat on the bus. Usually, we get there a bit early and there&#8217;s a small snack available to munch on if you skipped your breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service is a time of worship, sharing, and a sermon from one of the pastors or elders at the church. Most of us go to the English service, but there&#8217;s also a Mandarin/Cantonese service. On occasion there&#8217;s also a joint congregation service.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Sunday school, you can choose between two classes. One is a study of one of the books of the Bible (rotating between Genesis, John, Romans, and Acts) and the other is a more topical study (like how to study the Bible). Afterwards, we have lunch at the church and then take the bus back.
    </p>

      Not all ACF members attend PCC. If it's not your cup of tea, take a look at our <a href="/links.html">links page</a> for other local churches.

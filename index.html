  <h2>Hiya! We&#8217;re college students in Pittsburgh who seek to know and love Jesus.</h2>

  <div id="intro-text">
    <p>
      We come from different schools such as Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, and CCAC. We&#8217;re here for those who seek to learn more about Jesus or how faith in God fits into the values and quirks of Asian culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hope is this website isn&#8217;t about how spiffy we are or how much we do, but rather how we are a body of believers who strive to be transformed from the inside out by the love of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pray that college wouldn&#8217;t just be an educational and social time but also a time to grow closer to God, and we would love to get to know you and grow with you. Below are some ways you can get plugged in!

	During the summer, we still have both large group and cell group meetings for those in the area. While the structure is similar to that of the school year, summer meetings are more relaxed while still not sacrificing our focus on Christ as the center of our lives.

      On Fridays, we gather as one body for musical worship, corporate prayer, topical Bible study, and small discussion groups. During the course of the year, we also occasionally have workshop nights, outreach events, and sharing nights.

      Just as your body's made up of little building blocks called cells, ACF is made up of cell groups: small, single-gender units who meet weekly to study the Bible, pray, and encourage one another.

      We&#8217;re a ministry of Pittsburgh Chinese Church, and we encourage you to join us on Sundays for worship, service, Sunday school, and lunch! To make things easy, there&#8217;s a bus which takes us to PCC with stops at both CMU and Pitt.

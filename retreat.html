  <h2>Join us in a weekend set apart to learn, worship, and fellowship.</h2>
  <p>Retreat is a time with God, both as a fellowship and as an individual. It is a three day long trip, Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, structured around and through times of musical worship, messages, discussion groups, workshops, devotions, and prayer. We value retreat as a time to be physically and mentally away from school, work, and busyness, things that normally occupy much of our mind and heart. In place of these things, we hope that you can come and find rest in God through retreat.
  </p>
  <p>This year retreat is from <b>Friday January 29, 2016 - Sunday January 31, 2016.</b>
  </p>

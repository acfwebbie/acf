      Large Group is a time of corporate fellowship. This usually includes worship and a Bible-based discussion. The topic of study this summer is 1 Thessalonians. There will be six "typical" large groups as described above with an additional two Fridays set aside for special events. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Come check out large group! We hope to see you there.

      Jesus wasn&#8217;t just about the crowds, but also a personal relationship with his disciples. That&#8217;s what cell group is about; smaller groups where you can grown in discipleship on a more intimate and personal level than in large group or church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to our smaller number, we only have one cell group for each gender during the summertime. This is a great oppertunity to deepen relationships with those in Pittsburgh over the summer months.

      Every Sunday, many ACFers attend service and Sunday school at <a href="http://www.pittsburghchinesechurch.org/">Pittsburgh Chinese Church</a>. Usually, we get there a bit early and there&#8217;s a small snack available to munch on if you skipped your breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service is a time of worship, sharing, and a sermon from one of the pastors or elders at the church. Most of us go to the English service, but there&#8217;s also a Mandarin/Cantonese service. On occasion, there&#8217;s also a joint congregation service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all ACF members attend PCC. If it's not your cup of tea, take a look at our <a href="/links">links page</a> for other local churches.
